soundecol
=========

Draft of R package with functions for soundscape ecology and other research in ecology that uses audio recordings.

Scripts are being tested with the original to confirm that the code is correct. NONE HAVE BEEN COMPARED WITH THE ORIGINAL YET. Wait for testing or use with caution.

Scripts should be usable by now, but very little documentation is available in R format. Please refer to the papers for more info.

Feel free to contribute.
