sample sound files
=========

This folder is a container for 250 test sound files in wav format. Since these are too big for the git archive (1.4Gb) they are at: http://research.coquipr.com/soundecology/sounds/

Each filename has the date and time, encoded as: LINE_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS.wav
Each file was recorded using a sampling rate of 48000Hz and were cut to 50 seconds.
