NDSI test
=========

This folder is a test in 90 wav files of the NDSI obtained from the original Matlab code compared to the ndsi from the package. Since these are too big for the git archive (240MB) they are at: 

 http://research.coquipr.com/soundecology/

Each filename has the date and time, encoded as: LA##_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.wav

The file M-R-Merge-60S.CSV contains the results from the Matlab script NDSI.m.
