# An Introduction to **soundecology** package #

## Introduction ##

The  **soundecology** package has functions to calculate indices for soundscape ecology and other ecology research that uses audio recordings.


## Indices ##

The package **soundecology** can calculate several indices:

### ACI ###

The ACI is based on the "observation that many biotic sounds, such as bird songs, are 
characterized by an intrinsic variability of intensities, while some types
of human generated noise (such as car passing or airplane transit)
present very constant intensity values" (Pieretti, et al. 2011).
```{r results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(soundecology)

data(tropicalsound)
	ACI <- acoustic_complexity(tropicalsound)
	print(ACI$AciTotAll_left)
	
	summary(ACI)
```
